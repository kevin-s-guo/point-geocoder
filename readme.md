## Geocoder Platform

![Version](https://badgen.net/github/release/kevin-s-guo/point-geocoder) [![Docker](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/docker?icon=docker&label)](https://hub.docker.com/u/ksgi)

### Dependencies
Docker needs to be installed on the host. See [this](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) page for Docker installation instructions.

### Docker setup
In order to deploy the geocoder platform, download and extract [the whole respository](https://github.com/kevin-s-guo/point-geocoder/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). In the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml`, run the following command. The app directory contains the Python code for the web container, and changes in files in that directory will be reflected in the web container.

``$ docker compose pull``

This will pull the two images required. 

Before the web app will work, the PostgreSQL database will need to be set up.

First, create and start the database container with docker compose.

``$ docker compose up -d db``

Next, run the setup shell script. 

``$ docker exec point-db sh load_default.sh``

`load_default.sh` will install PostGIS (the spatial database extension), download 2020 census data, import 2010 block-group boundaries, and create the necessary tables for the web app. Depending on download speed, this may take hours. The full US Census data will take up approximately 100 gigabytes of storage.

When this is done, the python web server container can be started with the following command.

``$ docker compose up``

If everything worked according to plan, navigating to `localhost:7001/docs` in a web browser should show the API documentation page. Navigating to `localhost:7001/web` will bring up the graphical user interface. 

### Loading Built-in SDOH Databases 

``$ docker exec point-web python3 sdoh_util.py``

Restart the web server container so that the newly loaded databases are shown.

``$ docker compose restart web``

Navigate to `localhost:7001/web/var_list/` to view the list of geographic variables available along with descriptions and links to source websites.

### Suspending POINT

In order to suspend the application, use the following command.

``$ docker compose stop``

Using `docker compose down` will delete the containers, but if the `-v` flag is not used, the persistent volume (named `gisdata`) where the GIS data is stored will not be deleted..

## Updating POINT 

First, make sure that the POINT application is stopped (using `docker compose stop`). In order to preserve the data stored in the database service, use the following two commands to remove only the web container and associated image.

``$ docker rm point-web``
``$ docker image rm geocoder-platform-web``

Then, restart the whole application with `docker compose`.

``$ docker compose up``

The version tagged `latest` will automatically downloaded and be swapped in from Docker Hub.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How many threads can run a single instance of POINT run at once?

By default, the worker process is set up to allow 10 threads at once. In order to adjust the maximum concurrency, edit the following line in `docker-compose.yml`.

``entrypoint: celery -A worker.celery worker --loglevel=info -c <desired concurrency, default is 10>``
